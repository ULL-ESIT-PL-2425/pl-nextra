# while ... end while as a synonym of while( ...)

The "Begin End Something" Language Design Pattern works as follows:

1. Add a couple of tokens to the language to signal the beginning and the end of the **new specialized category of expressions**:  for instance add `[` to begin array literals and `]` to end array literals
   * Introduce the new tokens in the lexer (be carefull with conflicts, specially with "expansive" tokens. Don't trample on existing "reserved words")
   * Modify the grammar adding the new rule(s) for the new kind of expression
2. Build an AST for the the new category by adding a function `buildCategory` to your `build-ast.js` library.
   * The function `buildCategory` returns in fact a specialized case of an already existent kind of AST
   * Remember to export the new function and import the new function in your grammar file

Following these instructions extend Egg with a construct `while (expression) expression end while` that works as a synonym of `while( ...)`:

```ruby
egg-oop-parser-solution git:(master) âœ— cat examples/while-return-value.egg 
do(
    def(i,1),
    def(r, 
      while (<(i,4))
        do(
          print(i),
          =(i, +(i,1))
        ) 
      end while # while
    ),
    print(r)
)
```
