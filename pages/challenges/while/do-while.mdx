# Challenge for lab {frontmatter().practica}: do while

Add a `do ... while` construct to the calculator language. 
The `do` construct is similar to the `while` construct, but it tests the condition at the end of the loop body instead of the beginning. This means that the body is always run at least once.

Add tests for the new construct.
