## Exam: Parsing RegExps

* Read carefully [the pdf with the questions](https://github.com/ULL-ESIT-PL/exam-training-template/blob/master/docs/exam.pdf)
* Fill the code in this template repo [ULL-ESIT-PL/exam-training-template](https://github.com/ULL-ESIT-PL/exam-training-template)

[AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net/#/gist/4ea2b52f0e546af6fb14f9b2f5671c1c/49dafda5429858220f62387740fd4226cdc3dde0) supports various regexp parsers. Feel free to play with them and have a look at the shapes of the ASTs.

## Exam: Parsing JSON

* [Exam Parsing JSON](/assets/old-exam-sample.pdf): pdf file. Question: Parse the JSON Language 
  
### Examples of Solutions

* [Solution: JSON parser in nearley.js](https://github.com/ULL-ESIT-PL/learning-nearley/blob/main/examples/json.ne)
  * Task to do: Improve the solution by using your own lexical analyzer generator instead of the current moo lexer, removing the explicit use of white spaces (syntactic variable `_` like in the production rule `pair -> key _ ":" _ value`) in the Nearley grammar
* [Solution: JSON parser in yacc](https://gist.github.com/justjkk/436828/)
* [Solution: JSON parser in pegjs](https://github.com/pegjs/pegjs/blob/master/examples/json.pegjs)

## Exam: Translator from Egg AST to AST Term 

### Question 

Here is a variant of the previous exam.

Assume the input JSON contains an Egg AST and translate it to AST Term notation.

### The Term Language to Summarize ASTs

`Term` is a DSL to summarize ASTs. Here is an attempt to describe the language:

```
term -> ('NAME' ':')? 'TYPE' '(' term (',' term)* ')'
  | leaf
leaf -> ('NAME' ':')? 'TYPE' ('{' 'ATTRIBUTE' '}')?
```

* Token `'NAME'` is the name of the child in the node, 
* Token `'TYPE'` represents the type of the node, 
* The token `'ATTRIBUTE'` is the JSON stringify of a single attribute of the leaf node. 

To summarize the AST the following rules are followed: 

* Only the type of the node is shown
* Only one selected attribute of a leaf is shown (Between curly brackets)
* Array n-ary nodes are allowed (and they go between brackets)

Here is an example. Given the input program:

```ruby
➜  evm2term git:(master) cat examples/property.egg 
x["sub", 1]("length") # 3
``` 

Whose JSON looks like:

```json showLineNumbers filename=examples/property.json
➜  evm2term git:(master) cat examples/property.json
{
  "type": "apply",
  "operator": {
    "type": "property",
    "operator": {
      "type": "word",
      "line": 1,
      "col": 1,
      "length": 1,
      "name": "x"
    },
    "args": [
      {
        "type": "value",
        "value": "sub",
        "line": 1,
        "col": 3,
        "length": 5,
        "raw": "\"sub\""
      },
      {
        "type": "value",
        "value": 1,
        "line": 1,
        "col": 10,
        "length": 1
      }
    ]
  },
  "args": [
    {
      "type": "value",
      "value": "length",
      "line": 1,
      "col": 13,
      "length": 8,
      "raw": "\"length\""
    }
  ]
}
```

The output of the `evm2term` translator will be:

```js
➜  evm2term git:(master) evm2term examples/property.json 
apply(op:property(op:word{x}, args:[value{sub},value{1}]), args:[value{length}])
```


### Example of Solution

* See package [evm2term](https://www.npmjs.com/package/evm2term) and file [crguezl/evm2term/index.js](https://github.com/crguezl/evm2term/blob/master/index.js) for a solution using `estraverse`
