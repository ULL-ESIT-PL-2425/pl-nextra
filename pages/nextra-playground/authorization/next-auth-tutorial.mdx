# Auth.js tutorial for Next.js with GitHub

These are my random notes about the tutorial [OAuth tutorial](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/oauth-tutorial) that teaches how setting Auth.js in a web application to be able to log in with GitHub.

## Configuring Auth.js

To add Auth.js to your project:

## Installing NextAuth.js

```bash npm2yarn
npm install next-auth
```

## Middleware

See section [Middleware](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/nextjs#middleware)


https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/nextjs#basic-usage

## Creating the server config

Create the following [API route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/dynamic-api-routes#catch-all-api-routes) file. This route contains the necessary configuration for NextAuth.js, as well as the dynamic route handler:

```js filename="pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import GithubProvider from "next-auth/providers/github"

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [
    GithubProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GITHUB_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_SECRET,
    }),
  ],
})
```

<Callout type="info">

Behind the scenes, this creates all the relevant OAuth API routes within `/api/auth/*` so that auth API requests to:

- [GET `/api/auth/signin`](https://authjs.dev/reference/rest-api#get--apiauthsignin)
- [POST `/api/auth/signin/:provider`](https://authjs.dev/reference/rest-api#post--apiauthsigninprovider)
- [GET/POST `/api/auth/callback/:provider`](https://authjs.dev/reference/rest-api#get--post--apiauthcallbackprovider)
- [GET `/api/auth/signout`](https://authjs.dev/reference/rest-api#get--apiauthsignout)
- [POST `/api/auth/signout`](https://authjs.dev/reference/rest-api#post--apiauthsignout)
- [GET `/api/auth/session`](https://authjs.dev/reference/rest-api#get--apiauthsession)
- [GET `/api/auth/csrf`](https://authjs.dev/reference/rest-api#get--apiauthcsrf)
  - **[CSRF](/nextra-playground/authorization/csrf)** stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery, which is a type of security threat in web applications. It's not directly a part of authorization mechanisms but rather a vulnerability that can occur when proper authorization controls are not in place or are circumvented. 
- [GET `/api/auth/providers`](https://authjs.dev/reference/rest-api#get--apiauthproviders)

can be handled by NextAuth.js. In this way, NextAuth.js stays in charge of the whole application's authentication request/response flow.

NextAuth.js is customizable. The [NextAuth guides](https://authjs.dev/guides) teaches you how to set it up to handle auth in different ways. All the possible configuration options are [listed here](https://authjs.dev//reference/core#authconfig).

## Adding environment variables

Notice we are using environment variables in the code example above. 
We take the value of `GITHUB_ID` and `GITHUB_SECRET` from the GitHub Developer OAuth Portal. 
See [Configuring OAuth Provider](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/oauth-tutorial#2-configuring-oauth-provider) section on how to get those.

In your project root, create a `.env.local` file and add the `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` environment variable:

```bash filename=".env.local" copy {1}
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="This is an example"
```

`NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is a random string used by the library to encrypt tokens and email verification hashes,
 and **it's mandatory to keep things secure**! 🔥 🔐 . You can use:

```bash copy {1}
openssl rand -base64 32
```

or https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32 to generate a random value for it.

## signOut()

- Client Side: Yes
- Server Side: No

In order to logout, use the `signOut()` method to ensure the user ends back on the page they started on after completing the sign out flow. It also handles [CSRF](/nextra-playground/authorization/csrf) tokens for you automatically.

It reloads the page in the browser when complete.

```js
import { signOut } from "next-auth/react"

export default () => <button onClick={() => signOut()}>Sign out</button>

```
