<Callout type="info">
NextAuth.js will already create this API endpoint for you when we start the application later. Note that because we're using Next.js, locally it starts our server on port `3000` by default. Hence, the origin is `http://localhost:3000`.

<Callout type="info">
The last part of the URL, `[provider]`, is the ID of the provider you're using. In this case, we're using GitHub, so it's `github`. If you're using Google, it'll be `google`, etc... We keep track of the provider IDs internally.

The same id is used in the `signIn()` method we saw earlier.
</Callout>

To register, tap on "Register application" button.

The next screen shows all the configurations for your newly created OAuth app. For now, we need two things from it - the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**:

<img src={gettingClientIdSecretImg} />

The Client ID is always there, a public identifier of your OAuth application within GitHub. Click on the **Generate a new client Secret** button and should be presented with a new string (which is just a randomized string).

</Callout>
Keep both your Client ID and Client Secret secure and never expose them to the public or share them with people outside your organization. With them, a malicious actor could hijack your application and cause you and your user serious problems!
</Callout>

Cool! We have finished configuring our OAuth provider, now let's wire all together so we can finally see authentication working in our app!

<Callout type="info">
As noted previously, NextAuth.js has built-in support for multiple OAuth providers, <a href="">here is the full list</a>. You can also easily build your own in case the provider you need is not on the list.

Note that, for each provider, the configuration process will be similar to what we just did:

1. Log in to the provider
2. Create create your OAuth application within it
3. Set the callback URL
4. Get the Client ID and Generate a Client Secret
