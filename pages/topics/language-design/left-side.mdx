# Chat GPT on Programming Languages allowing f(3) = 9  for a function f

Follows a chat with GPT-3 on the topic of the existence of programming languages that allow you to assign a value to a function at a specific point, like `f(3) = 9`.


## Question

In most programming languages you can put on the left side of an assignment a property of an object or an index of an array like:

For an array:
```
a[0] = 4;
```
or  for an object:

```
a["x"] = 9 
```

but you can't do something like this for the value of a function at a specific point like in:

```
f(3) = 9;
```

**Do you know of any programming language in which you can write something like this?**

## Chat GPT Answer

<Callout type="info">
 **While it's not exactly the same syntax as `f(3) = 9`, a few programming paradigms and languages offer features that allow you to achieve a similar effect, treating functions more flexibly:**

**1. Dynamic Languages with Closures:**

- **Python, JavaScript, and other dynamic languages often allow you to create closuresâ€”functions that capture and modify variables from their surrounding scope**. This can be used to create a function that "remembers" certain values and effectively updates itself.

   ```javascript
   function createCounter() {
       let count = 0;
       return function() {
           count = count + 1;
           return count;
       };
   }

   let myCounter = createCounter();
   console.log(myCounter());  // 1
   console.log(myCounter());  // 2
   ```

**2. Prototype-Based Languages:**

- **Languages like JavaScript and Lua use prototype-based inheritance, where you can modify an object's methods (functions) directly**. This means you can indirectly "update" a function's behavior for a specific instance.

   ```javascript
   function Person(name) {
       this.name = name;
       this.greet = function() {
           console.log("Hello, I'm " + this.name);
       };
   }

   let person1 = new Person("Alice");
   person1.greet();  // "Hello, I'm Alice"
   person1.greet = function() {
       console.log("Hi there! ");
   };
   person1.greet();  // "Hi there! "
   ```

**3. Semantic Function Assignment (Experimental):**

- **Some languages like R and Julia have explored "semantic function assignment," which allows you to create aliases or modify function definitions in certain contexts**. However, this feature is often limited and not universally supported.

**4. Symbolic Programming:**

- **In symbolic programming languages like Mathematica or SymPy, functions are often treated as symbolic expressions that can be manipulated algebraically.** This might allow for constructs that resemble assigning to function values, but it's a very different paradigm from traditional programming.

<Callout type="warning">
**Remember that these approaches don't directly modify a function's code itself; they create new functions or aliases with altered behavior.** Understanding these nuances is crucial for writing clear and maintainable code.
