# Chat GPT on Programming Languages allowing f(3) = 9  for a function f

Follows a chat with GPT-3 on the topic of the existence of programming languages that allow you to assign a value to a function at a specific point, like `f(3) = 9`.


## Question

In most programming languages you can put on the left side of an assignment a property of an object or an index of an array like:

For an array:
```
a[0] = 4;
```
or  for an object:

```
a["x"] = 9 
```

but you can't do something like this for the value of a function at a specific point like in:

```
f(3) = 9;
```

**Do you know of any programming language in which you can write something like this?**

## Chat GPT Answer

<Callout type="info">
In most programming languages, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed around and manipulated like any other data type. **However, the ability to assign a value to the result of a function call directly, as in `f(3) = 9;`, is not a common feature in programming languages**.

However, *there are some languages that allow you to achieve similar behavior using various mechanisms*. One such language is Mathematica.

In Mathematica, you can define functions with pattern-matching rules, and you can use these rules to effectively assign values to function inputs. Here's an example:

```mathematica
f[x_] := 2x + 1

(* Now we can define values for specific inputs *)
f[3] = 9

(* You can now call f[3] and it will return the assigned value *)
f[3]
(* Output: 9 *)
```

In this example, we defined a function `f[x_]` which represents a **linear equation**. Then, we assigned a specific value `9` to `f[3]`. Now, whenever you call `f[3]`, it will return `9`.

Mathematica's pattern-matching rules and symbolic computation capabilities enable this behavior, allowing for a more symbolic and mathematical programming style compared to traditional imperative languages. However, it's important to note that Mathematica operates in a different paradigm compared to most mainstream programming languages, and **direct function value assignment like this is not a common feature in those languages**.

### Comments to Chat GPT answer

Notice the Mathematica example refers to a "linear equation" and not to a "function".

Here follows a Google Gemini answer to the exactly the same question:

<Callout type="info">
 **While it's not exactly the same syntax as `f(3) = 9`, a few programming paradigms and languages offer features that allow you to achieve a similar effect, treating functions more flexibly:**

**1. Dynamic Languages with Closures:**

- **Python, JavaScript, and other dynamic languages often allow you to create closuresâ€”functions that capture and modify variables from their surrounding scope**. This can be used to create a function that "remembers" certain values and effectively updates itself.

   ```javascript
   function createCounter() {
       let count = 0;
       return function() {
           count = count + 1;
           return count;
       };
   }

   let myCounter = createCounter();
   console.log(myCounter());  // 1
   console.log(myCounter());  // 2
   ```

**2. Prototype-Based Languages:**

- **Languages like JavaScript and Lua use prototype-based inheritance, where you can modify an object's methods (functions) directly**. This means you can indirectly "update" a function's behavior for a specific instance.

   ```javascript
   function Person(name) {
       this.name = name;
       this.greet = function() {
           console.log("Hello, I'm " + this.name);
       };
   }

   let person1 = new Person("Alice");
   person1.greet();  // "Hello, I'm Alice"
   person1.greet = function() {
       console.log("Hi there! ");
   };
   person1.greet();  // "Hi there! "
   ```

**3. Semantic Function Assignment (Experimental):**

- **Some languages like R and Julia have explored "semantic function assignment," which allows you to create aliases or modify function definitions in certain contexts**. However, this feature is often limited and not universally supported.

**4. Symbolic Programming:**

- **In symbolic programming languages like Mathematica or SymPy, functions are often treated as symbolic expressions that can be manipulated algebraically.** This might allow for constructs that resemble assigning to function values, but it's a very different paradigm from traditional programming.

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Remember that these approaches don't directly modify a function's code itself; they create new functions or aliases with altered behavior.** Understanding these nuances is crucial for writing clear and maintainable code.
