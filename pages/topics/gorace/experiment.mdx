GoRace is a web app designed at [Universidad de Cadiz](https://gorace.uca.es/en/about-us) to gamify a set of activities. 
Visit the landing page at https://gorace.uca.es/.
Once the race manager/teacher has set the race, the runner/students's progress in the activities is visualized as an Olympic race which is set by the manager.

As his TFM, our student [Claudio Nestor](https://github.com/claudio4) is writing an extension web app (a web service plus a Cli, plus a GitHub app) for GoRace that allows to feed a GoRace "race" with the student results provided by the GitHub Classroom Autograding System.

The software is now reaching an state in which we can make a test and thus we are intending to use it for the lab [left-side](/labs/left-side).

These are the instructions for the race:

1. You will receive an email to register for the race. Please click on the link to accept your registration in GoRace.  
2. Do not start pushing to the assignment repo until you have accepted the race.

If you want to collaborate with us, please follow these instructions.
