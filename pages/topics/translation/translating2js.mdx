import {Link, frontmatter} from '@/src/frontmatter'

## 1. Write an example of the new feature

When you are translating a new feature to JavaScript, it is a good idea to write an example of the new feature in the original language. This will help you understand the feature and its behavior.

For instance, when the new feature is while loops, you can write a (future) test for the new feature in the original language

```js filename="test/data/input/while.calc" showLineNumbers copy {3-6}
➜  functions-solution git:(while) cat test/data/input/while.calc 
a = 0,
b = while a < 10 {
  print(a),
  a = a +1
},
print(b) # 10
```

## 2. Write the JS code you expect for such example

Then, you can start writing by hand the code you expect for such example in JavaScript.

You don't need to do everything, only the specific part of the code that you are working on.
In the example below you concentrate on lines 13-20 below that 
define the **translation scheme** for the while loop in the code above.

```js filename="test/data/actualjs/while.js" showLineNumbers copy {13-20}
➜  functions-solution git:(while) npx prettier test/data/expectedjs/while.js 
#!/usr/bin/env node
const { Complex, print, } = require("/Users/casianorodriguezleon/campus-virtual/2223/pl2223/practicas/functions/functions-solution/src/support-lib.js");

/* End of support code */

let $a, $b;

(
    ($a = Complex("0")),
    (
        $b = (
        () => {
            let result = false;
            while ($a.lessThan(Complex("10"))) {
                result = (print($a), ($a = $a.add(Complex("1"))));
            }

            return result;
        })()
    )
),
print($b);
```

## 3. Go to ast explorer or use compast to learn the shape of the AST

I'll use it here  version `4.1.0` of `compast` to generate the AST for the code above but you can 
use the AST explorer as well.

```
✗ npm i -g compact-js-ast@4.1.0
✗ compast --version
4.1.0
```
Here are the options supported in this version of `compast`:

```
✗ compast --help
Usage: compast [options] [filename]

Converts a JS program into a JSON or YML AST format

Arguments:
  filename                    file with the original code

Options:
  -V, --version               output the version number
  -o, --output <filename>     file name of the json putput program
  -p, --program <JS program>  JS program is given in the command line
  -jw --whites <string>       string '  ' Specifies the number of whites for formatting the object
                              (default: "  ")
  -e --hide <fieldnames...>   List of AST fields to omit (default: [])
  -f --hideFile <fileName>    File with a line per AST fields to omit
  -j --json                   output in JSON format (default is YML
  -n --no-parse               do not parse the code, assume the input is already an AST in json format
  -a --all                    output all fields
  -l --location               omit only location fields
  -h, --help                  display help for command
```

Now generate the AST for the code you expect for the while loop in the code above. The `-j` option is used to generate the AST in JSON format. The `-o` option is used to specify the output file.

```sh
✗ compast -j test/data/expectedjs/while.js -o test/data/expectedAST/while.json
```

Edit the JSON with VSCode and get familiar with the different nodes and their properties.
By navigating in the JSON you can detect that the node you are interested in
is  the `CallExpression` node with `callee`  an `ArrowFunctionExpression`. 

### jq and jless

Namely in the `jq` language the node of the AST we are interested in is:

```jq /jless/
✗ jq '.body[2].expression.expressions[0].expressions[1].right' test/data/expectedAST/while.json
| jless
```

Notice the use of `jless` a utility that can be used to navigate any JSON in the command line:

## 4. Substitute the fixed parts by your AST parameters

Now you are in condition to start writing the `buildWhileExpression` function associated to the construct

```jsx src/ast-build.js
buildWhileExpression(test, body) {
   return <Paste here the output of the JSON object>
}
```

substitute the fixed ASTs by your variables `test` and `body` that were built by the parser

```js filename="src/grammar.jison"
  | WHILE e '{' e '}'   { $$ = buildWhileExpression($e1, $e2); }
```

and you are almost done!
